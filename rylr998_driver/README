# RYLR998 LoRa Linux Driver

This driver provides kernel support for the RYLR998 LoRa module via UART using the `serdev` subsystem.

## Installation

1. Build the driver:

    make

2. Apply the Device Tree overlay (requires root):

    sudo apply_rylr998_overlay.sh

> The overlay must be applied so the kernel can detect the RYLR998 device and automatically load the driver.

## Notes

- Make sure the script is executable:

    chmod +x apply_rylr998_overlay.sh

- For automatic application at boot, you can create a systemd service to run this script.
