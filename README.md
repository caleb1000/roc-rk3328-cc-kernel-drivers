Work In Progress: Current driver only enables the lsm6ds3 via SPI at 6.66 kHz and only for accelerometer data.
Plans in the future include making other drivers for the platform and expanding on the current driver. Current driver exposed the raw accelerometer data via the industrial io linux subsystem.
